# Embeded C


In this project I try to learn new concepts on operating systems and embeded software and review things I saw on college on classes like Introduction to Operating Systems, Distributed Systems or 

Computer Arquitecture for example. During my time in college I always enjoyed this topics and wanted to know more about how computers actually work behind the scenes and the high levels of 

abstractions, I wish I would have taken more computer engineering classes like System Administration or Operating Systems. 


I will update this readme as I move to move advanced topics doing side projects or entering into some intership where I can learn more about systems programming. I want to get to the fundamentals and

want to learn more each day.
